PHP MVC is an application design pattern that separates the application data and business logic (model) from the presentation (view).


* MVC stands for Model, View & Controller


1> Model


The model is responsible for managing the data of the application. It responds to the request from the view and it also responds to instructions from the controller to update itself.
